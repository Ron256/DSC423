Houses projects for the quarter in Data Analysis and Regression.

Home Work Assignment project 1 focussed on:
 - Fitting a regression model.
 - Explaining the regression fallacy.
 - Understanding the empirical rule.
 - Explaining the results of the regression model.
 
Home Work Assignment project 2 focussed on:
- Explaining the four assumptions about the residuals.
- understanding the use of interaction terms.
- using scatterplots to visualize the associations or relationship between variables.
- Computing correlations between variables.
- estimating a regression model and explaining the results.
- understanding why a good model should have significant independent variables.
- deriving a regression model with interaction and second-order terms.

Home Work Assignment project 3 focussed on:
- adding dummy variables to a regression model.
- inspecting the model with the summary() function.
- using the vif() function to detect multicollinearity.
- Interpreting the results of the final model.

Home Work Assignment project 4 focussed on:
- using and building regularized regression models.
- deriving a ridge regression model and presenting its results.
- deriving a LASSO regression model and presenting its results.
- creating a logistic regression model for classification.

Group Project focussed on predicting the number of COVID-19 Death cases in the U.S using regression analysis. Our analysis was performed using multiple regressions including first-order and interaction terms using the different age group variables along with the conditions, condition groups and regions.We use the F-Test, Adjusted R-Squared to measure the models.
